# Delani Studio
#### Web landing page for Delani Studio, {24th March 2023}
#### By **John Owino, Moringa School Mentors**
## Description
This application creates the landing page for Delani Studio. The website is divided in sections to make it easy for the user to navigate. It includes  the "Welcome", "About Us", "Services", "What We Do", "Portfolio" and a "Contact Us" sections.

The 'What We Do'  icons, when clicked, should toggle between the respective description of each icon. The description should be centered aligned. The header should be in bold and centered also.

The application has a Hover effect for the **Portfolio ** sections such that on hover a white box appears with the name of the project inside. The project picture should still be visible in the background.

The site is to be responsive.

The site should allow visitors to enter their names and email addresses.
The application should tell the user through a pop up that their message has been received and also thank you for contacting us . For example: ** johndoe we have received your message. Thank you for reaching out to us. **

As a bonus, the application should use mail chimp API to track all the emails and messages from your users.

Google fonts have been used on the site.

The project should be hosted on github pages.
